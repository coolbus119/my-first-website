<p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace_class_(United_States)" target = "_blank" title = "A airspace">C L A S S  A Airspace</a> : 
1.   All airspace from 18,000 feet up to and including FL 600 within the 48 contiguous States (including the 
District of Columbia) and most of Alaska plus the airspace within 12 NM offshore.
There is no Class A airspace over Hawaii and the Victor airways have no upper limit in Hawaii.
2.   AM aircraft MUST be IFR unless otherwise authorized.  No VFR (unless for purposes of lost communications).
3.   No minimum flight visibility or distance from clouds is specified.
4.   Altimeter setting for all aircraft — 29.92 (in US controlled airspace).</p>
<p style = "margin-top:40px">C L A S S  B Airspace : (71.41, 91.117, 91.126, 91.127, 91.129, 91.130, 91.131, 91.155, 91.215, AIM 3-2-1,3-2-3)
1.     Surface to 7,000 feet or up to 12,500 feet surrounding the nation’s busiest airports.
2 .     Individually tailored upside-down wedding cakes —  contain all instrument approaches.
3.    Clearance into Class B required. (91.131, Letter of Interpretation from Office of Chief Counsel dated Jan 10, 2010) 
4.   VFR operations — 3 miles —  Clear of Clouds and at least a 1,000 ft ceiling (or Special VFR).
5.    IFR operations — An operable VOR or TACAN receiver is required. (91.131)
6 .     Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, a LARGE TURBINE-POWERED airplane operating to or from a 
primary airport in Class B airspace MUST operate AT or ABOVE the FLOORS of the Class B airspace 
while within the lateral limits of that area even when operating on a visual approach.
A LARGE (more than 12,500 lbs) o r TURBINE-POWERED airplane shall, unless otherwise required by 
distance from cloud criteria, enter the TRAFFIC PATTERN at an altitude of at least 1.500 feet AGL and 
maintain 1,500 AGL until further descent is required for a safe landing.  [Noise abatement]
8 .         A large or turbine-powered airplane approaching to land on a runway served by an ILS shall fly at or 
above the GLIDE SLOPE between the outer marker and the middle marker.
9.   Any airplane approaching to land on a runway served by a VASI shall maintain at or above the glide 
slope (aka glide path) until a lower altitude is necessary for a safe landing.
10. Mode C veil —  All aircraft operating within 30 NM of a Class B airport, from the surface to 10,000 feet 
must have Mode C  (unless the aircraft was originally certified without an electrical system and still does not have one).</p>
